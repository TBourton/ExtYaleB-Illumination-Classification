# ExtYaleB-Illumination-Classification
Classification of Illumination levels in ExtYaleB cropped dataset.

YaleB Extended. Download link here http://vision.ucsd.edu/~leekc/ExtYaleDatabase/ExtYaleB.html (Download cropped version). The notebook expects all images to be converted to PNG format (as tensorflow does not work nicely with .pgm).

Weights can be downloaded from the output of the kaggle version of this notebook.
